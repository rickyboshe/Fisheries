# Seafood: The Ultimate Food üêü?

</center>

As more people are opting against red meat diet for plant based and sea
food, this might be a good time to analyze aquatic food sources. The
[environmental
impact](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/why-meat-is-bad-for-the-environment/#:~:text=It%20causes%20climate%20change,the%20atmosphere%2C%20accelerating%20global%20warming)
of industrialized red meat production and [health
concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/health/red-meat-heart-cancer.html)
has made sea food a favourable alternative diet also termed as
[‚Äúpescatarian
diet‚Äù](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323907#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20pescatarian%20diet%3F&text=In%20the%20pescatarian%20diet%2C%20a,and%20fish%20products%20may%20enhance).

Utilizing visualization, this project explores:

1.  Sustainability of seafood. **Goal:** Exploring how sustainable the
    fishing rates are across the fishing regions in USA. Environmentally
    and Fish populations.
2.  Nutritional value of seafood. **Goal:** Establishing the nutritional
    value of fish species found across US marine. Compare species,
    identify trends and comparison with other food sources e.g.¬†beef.

This project primarily analyzes the fisheries management dataset from
the [National Oceanic and Atmostpheric Administration
(NOAA)](https://www.fishwatch.gov/resources). Accessing the latest data
using their **FishWatch API**.

If you are not familiar with pulling data using APIs, this project might
be helpful as this was alo my first attempt utilizing an API.

#### Acessing the data

``` r
#Create a function to request the endpoint and receive a dataframe converted from JSON
fish<- function(endpoint) {
  url <- modify_url("https://www.fishwatch.gov", path = endpoint)
  response<-GET(url)
  
  #tracking status codes
  if(http_error(response)){
    print(status_code(response))
    stop("Something went wrong.", call. = FALSE)
  }
  
  if(http_type(response)!="application/json"){
    stop("API did not return json", call. = FALSE)
  }
  #Get content as text
  json_text<- content(response, as="text")
  dataframe<-fromJSON(json_text)
  return(dataframe)
  
}

fish.df<-as_tibble(flatten(fish("/api/species?format=json")))

#Remain with variables useful in the analysis
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  select(2,7,8,12,14,17:19,26,29,32,33,36,41,45:47,
        49,51,56)
var_name<-data.frame(names(fish.df))
var_name<-var_name%>%
  rename(Variables=names.fish.df.)
```

We have reduced it to the essential variables we shall use to evaluate
some of the seafood being monitored by NOAA.

Using REGEX function to parse througfh the coloumns to remove html tags
and make the data easier to sort through. This is the major first step
to cleaning the dataset.

``` r
#The data contains html tags throughout the columns. Clean them out
cleanFun <- function(htmlString) {
  return(gsub("<.*?>", "", htmlString))
}
fish.df<-data.frame(map(fish.df, cleanFun))
```

### Data Cleaning

#### Fishing Rates

``` r
#Categorize population(naive categorization using the first instance of the words "Above", "Unknown" and "Below")
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(population=ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Aa]bove"), "Above target", 
                    ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Uu]nknown"), "Unknown",
                           ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Bb]elow|Near"),"Below target", NA))))    
```

    ##     Population Species
    ## 1 Above target      72
    ## 2 Below target      21
    ## 3      Unknown      13

``` r
#Categorize their availability (Annual or seasonal)
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(availability=ifelse(str_detect(Availability, "[Yy]ear-?round"), "Year round", "Seasonal"))    
```

    ##   Availability Species
    ## 1     Seasonal       6
    ## 2   Year round     108

For fish that are caught fresh in long periods of the year i.e.¬†6-8
months of the year, and are canned or frozen year long, are coded as
available **year-round**.

Fish that are caught on strict seasonal basis e.g.¬†June to October,
together with fish that are sporadically caught i.e.¬†Wreckfish, are
categorized as **seasonal**.

``` r
#Categorize the fishing rates
##regex to capture overfishing
rate_regex="i?(closed|prohibited|[Rr]educe(d)?|quota|(rates))"
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(fishing_rate=ifelse(str_detect(Fishing.Rate, "[Rr]ecommended|Not"), "Stable",
                             ifelse(str_detect(Fishing.Rate,rate_regex),"Over", "Unknown"))) 
```

    ##   Fishing rate Species
    ## 1         Over      14
    ## 2       Stable      91
    ## 3      Unknown       1

How the fishing rates were coded:

1.  **Over**: This include species are experiencing a mandated reduced
    fishing, species that are in regions where authorities have
    implemented quotas or rates to protect populations or fishing is
    out-right closed. e.g Sardines
2.  **Stable**: This include species that that are being fished at
    ‚Äúrecommended levels‚Äù within the fishing regions during the
    compilation of this data. e.g.¬†Lobster
3.  **Unknown**: This single observation is for the **California Market
    Squid** whose fishing rate and populations have not be estimated by
    NOAA.

``` r
#Categorize the environmental impact of species
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(env_effects=ifelse(str_detect(Environmental.Effects, "benefits"), "Net benefit",
                            ifelse(str_detect(Environmental.Effects, "state"), 
                                   "Federal monitoring","Unknown"))) 
```

    ##   Environmental Effects Species
    ## 1    Federal monitoring       2
    ## 2           Net benefit       6

Unfortunately, not all species have their environmental effects
recorded. Oysters, Mussels, Clams and Geoducks have been quoted to have
a ‚Äú**net benefit** on the environment as they remove excess nutrients
and improve water quality‚Äù. Sugar kelp have the same benefits with the
additional carbon fixing where they turn carbon-dioxide into oxygen.

The Atlantic Salmon and Sablefish are being actively monitored by the
federal and state authorities to ensure their fishing have minimal
impact on the environment.

<br></br> The most species are found in the Greater Atlantic area while
the least are found in the Pacific Island fishery region.

This means chances are, most of the fish people consume in the US comes
from the Greater Atlantic area! But does this mean the region is subject
to over fishing?

#### Regional Fishing Rates

We can examine how the fishing rates are in every region in the US. The
goal is to identify regions that are experiencing over fishing or are
within recommended fishing levels.

``` r
#Availability vs Fishing rate
plotdata <- fish.df%>%
  drop_na(fishing_rate)%>%
  group_by(noaa.fisheries.region, fishing_rate)%>%
  summarize(n = n())%>% 
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n),
         lbl = scales::percent(pct))

fig2<-plotdata%>%

  geom_text(aes(label = lbl), size = 3, 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title = "Fishing Rate by Fishing Region",
       x="",
       y="Percent")

#Plotly to make the chart more interactive
fig2<- ggplotly(fig2)%>% add_annotations( text="Fishing Rate", 
                                            xref="paper", yref="paper",
                                            x=1.02, xanchor="left",
                                            y=0.9, yanchor="bottom",
                                            legendtitle=TRUE, showarrow=FALSE )%>%
  layout(legend=list(y=0.9, yanchor="top"),xaxis=list(tickangle=-45))%>%
  style(hoverinfo = 'none')

fig2
```

<img src="Fisheries_files/figure-gfm/fig2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The majority of fishing regions are experiencing stable fishing rates,
well within recommended levels for existing populations. The Greater
Atlantic fishing zone has the highest levels of over fishing as compared
to the other regions (20%).

It looks like most fish species are rich in protein, selenium and
cholesterol. With the exception of Atlantic Bigeye Tuna and Pacific Blue
Marin, all fish species have nutrients that are within the recommended
dietary allowance in the USA.

All species show very low amounts of sugars, fat and saturated fatty
acids, which is good for heart health. For anyone looking for a low carb
diet, fish is the answer. They have very low carbohydrate per serving.

It would appear that the calories of fish have weak negative
relationship with the amount of carbohydrates and sugars. While there is
no significant relationship between fish calories with dietary fibers,
cholesterol and selenium. But there is a strong relationship between
fish calories and fat (r = 0.91), saturated fat (r = 0.90) and protein
(r = 0.39).

So for people trying to avoid fat and saturated fatty acids, fish might
not be the ideal dish for you. But for protein loading gym enthusiasts?
seafood is a good snack.

#### Comperative Quadrant

Looking at the four significant nutrients found in seafood i.e.¬†fat,
saturated fats, carbohydrates and protein, cholesterol, i utilized
quadrants to group seafood in 4 groups based on their average
nutritional value.

``` r
#fat
cal_mean<-mean(fish.df$calories, na.rm = TRUE)
f.per_mean<-mean(fish.df$fat_RDA, na.rm = TRUE)

fig8<-fish.df%>%

Above graphs depict a **nutritional value quadrant** for the fish
species found within the NOAA region. For all intents and purposes, the
species found in **quadrant 1** in each graph have the best value for
calories and their respective nutritional component.

As human diet differ across communities, some might be looking for
different levels of nutrients. It is important to be aware of how
calories relate to your diet of choice. Also to debunk any misguided
information one might have had prior.
