# Seafood: The Ultimate Food üêü?

As more people are opting against red meat diet for plant based and sea
food, this might be a good time to analyze aquatic food sources. The
[environmental
impact](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/why-meat-is-bad-for-the-environment/#:~:text=It%20causes%20climate%20change,the%20atmosphere%2C%20accelerating%20global%20warming)
of industrialized red meat production and [health
concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/health/red-meat-heart-cancer.html)
has made sea food a favourable alternative diet also termed as
[‚Äúpescatarian
diet‚Äù](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323907#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20pescatarian%20diet%3F&text=In%20the%20pescatarian%20diet%2C%20a,and%20fish%20products%20may%20enhance).

This project looks to answer two thing:

1.  But is sea food environmentally sustainable?
2.  Does it pack the nutrients to replace red meat diet?

We shall be utilizing the fisheries management dataset from the
[National Oceanic and Atmostpheric Administration
(NOAA)](https://www.fishwatch.gov/resources). Accessing the latest data
using their **FishWatch API**.

This is my first time attempting to work with APIs to access data. A
learning curve.

#### Acessing the data

``` r
#Create a function to request the endpoint and receive a dataframe converted from JSON

fish<- function(endpoint) {
  url <- modify_url("https://www.fishwatch.gov", path = endpoint)
  response<-GET(url)
  
  #tracking status codes
  if(http_error(response)){
    print(status_code(response))
    stop("Something went wrong.", call. = FALSE)
  }
  
  if(http_type(response)!="application/json"){
    stop("API did not return json", call. = FALSE)
  }
  #Get content as text
  json_text<- content(response, as="text")
  dataframe<-fromJSON(json_text)
  return(dataframe)
  
}

fish.df<-as_tibble(flatten(fish("/api/species?format=json")))

#Remain with variables useful in the analysis
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  select(2,7,8,12,14,17:19,26,29,32,33,36,41,45:47,
        49,51,56)
var_name<-data.frame(names(fish.df))
var_name<-var_name%>%
  rename(Variables=names.fish.df.)
```

We have reduced it to the essential variables we shall use to evaluate
some of the sea food being monitored by NOAA.

``` r
#The data contains html tags throughout the columns. Clean them out
cleanFun <- function(htmlString) {
  return(gsub("<.*?>", "", htmlString))
}
fish.df<-data.frame(map(fish.df, cleanFun))
```

### Fishing and impacts

``` r
#Categorize population(naive categorization using the first instance of the words "Above", "Unknown" and "Below")
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(population=ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Aa]bove"), "Above target", 
                    ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Uu]nknown"), "Unknown",
                           ifelse(str_detect(Population, "[Bb]elow|Near"),"Below target", NA))))    
```

    ##     Population Species
    ## 1 Above target      72
    ## 2 Below target      21
    ## 3      Unknown      13

``` r
#Categorize their availability (Annual or seasonal)
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(availability=ifelse(str_detect(Availability, "[Yy]ear-?round"), "Year round", "Seasonal"))    
```

    ##   Availability Species
    ## 1     Seasonal       6
    ## 2   Year round     108

For fish that are caught fresh in long periods of the year i.e.¬†6-8
months of the year, and are canned or frozen year long, are coded as
available year-round.

Fish that are caught on strict seasonal basis e.g.¬†June to October,
together with fish that are sporadically caught i.e.¬†Wreckfish, are
categorized as seasonal.

``` r
#Categorize the fishing rates
##regex to capture overfishing
rate_regex="i?(closed|prohibited|[Rr]educe(d)?|quota|(rates))"
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(fishing_rate=ifelse(str_detect(Fishing.Rate, "[Rr]ecommended|Not"), "Stable",
                             ifelse(str_detect(Fishing.Rate,rate_regex),"Over", "Unknown"))) 
```

    ##   Fishing rate Species
    ## 1         Over      14
    ## 2       Stable      91
    ## 3      Unknown       1

How the fishing rates were coded:

1.  **Over**: This include species are experiencing a mandated reduced
    fishing, species that are in regions where authorities have
    implemented quotas or rates to protect populations or fishing is
    out-right closed. e.g Sardines
2.  **Stable**: This include species that that are being fished at
    ‚Äúrecommended levels‚Äù within the fishing regions during the
    compilation of this data. e.g.¬†Lobster
3.  **Unknown**: This single observation is for the **California Market
    Squid** whose fishing rate and populations have not be estimated by
    NOAA.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#Categorize the environmental impact of species
fish.df<-fish.df%>%
  mutate(env_effects=ifelse(str_detect(Environmental.Effects, "benefits"), "Net benefit",
                            ifelse(str_detect(Environmental.Effects, "state"), "Federal monitoring",
                                   "Unknown"))) 
```

    ##   Environmental Effects Species
    ## 1    Federal monitoring       2
    ## 2           Net benefit       6

Unfortunately, not all species have their environmental effects
recorded. Oysters, Mussels, Clams and Geoducks have been quoted to have
a ‚Äú**net benefit** on the environment as they remove excess nutrients
and improve water quality‚Äù. Sugar kelp have the same benefits with the
additional carbon fixing where they turn carbon-dioxide into oxygen.

The Atlantic Salmon and Sablefish are being actively monitored by the
federal and state authorities to ensure their fishing have minimal
impact on the environment.
