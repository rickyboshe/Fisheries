# Seafood: The Ultimate Food üêü?

As more people are opting against red meat diet for plant based and sea
food, this might be a good time to analyze aquatic food sources. The
[environmental
impact](https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/why-meat-is-bad-for-the-environment/#:~:text=It%20causes%20climate%20change,the%20atmosphere%2C%20accelerating%20global%20warming)
of industrialized red meat production and [health
concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/health/red-meat-heart-cancer.html)
has made sea food a favourable alternative diet also termed as
[‚Äúpescatarian
diet‚Äù](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323907#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20pescatarian%20diet%3F&text=In%20the%20pescatarian%20diet%2C%20a,and%20fish%20products%20may%20enhance).

This project looks to answer two thing:

1.  But is sea food environmentally sustainable?
2.  Does it pack the nutrients to replace red meat diet?
